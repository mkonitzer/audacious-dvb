Things that need fixing:

- 'hangs' in bad reception conditions (seems fixed?)


Minor Improvements:

- automatic tagging of recorded files when using information
  retrieval.


Additional future functionality:

- support for conditional access via common interface when using the
  link layer firmware.

- I18N/locale-support

- DVB-T and DVB-C frontend support.
